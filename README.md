# # Delhi AQI Prediction Project Using Machining Learning

Air is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. Air is a mixture of about 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, 0.9% of argon, 0.04% of carbon dioxide, and very small amounts of other gases.

Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index(PM 2.5)

PM 2.5 is a fine particulate matter that is an air pollutant that is a concern for people’s health when levels in the air are high.

## The Motivation For The Project:
Due to COVID, there is no transportation throughout the world because of the air is so fresh. We know that Delhi is the most polluted city in India but in recent days here also the air is so fresh, I am thinking about it how the air is so fresh nowadays, what about last year how was the air quality last year from that thought this project born.


## What is AQI?
MoEFCC describes AQI or Air Quality Index as ‘One Number- One Colour-One Description’ for the layman to judge the air quality within his vicinity.

AQI is an index used to report daily air quality. It tells you how unhealthy the ambient air is and how polluted it can become in the near future. It also educates you on what associated health effects might be of concern. 
The Air Quality Index is a scale designed to communicate the current air quality status to the people in readily comprehensible terms. 


## Importance of AQI

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool that helps everyone understand how clean or polluted the air is. It uses colors and numbers to show this in a simple way. This is good because it tells people, especially those who work or play outside, how the air might affect their health. In places like India, where technical terms are hard for many to understand, the AQI makes it easier by not using complicated units. It also helps doctors know when bad air might cause more breathing problems for their patients.
